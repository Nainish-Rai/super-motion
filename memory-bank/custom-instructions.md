- do not overuse comments (only use comments if it is necessary to understand the code)
- keep the codebase minimal clean and basic (do not add unnecessary complexity)
- keep the things organized
- do not make large files than 400 lines
- keep hooks, fetching, calculations, apis in separate files
- keep components in separate files
- keep utils in separate files
- keep types in separate files
